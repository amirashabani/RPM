# What are Beamer, Pandoc, and Markdown?
- **Beamer**

	Beamer is a LaTeX **document class** for creating presentation slides, with a wide range of templates and a set of features for making slideshow effects.

	It supports pdfLaTeX, LaTeX + dvips, LuaLaTeX and XeLaTeX. The name is taken from the German word "Beamer" as a pseudo-anglicism for "video projector".

# What are Beamer, Pandoc, and Markdown?
- **Pandoc**

	Pandoc is a free and open-source **document converter**, widely used as a writing tool (especially by scholars) and as a basis for publishing workflows. It was created by John MacFarlane, a philosophy professor at the University of California, Berkeley.

# What are Beamer, Pandoc, and Markdown?
- **Markdown**

	Markdown is a lightweight **markup language** with plain text formatting syntax. Its design allows it to be converted to many output formats, but the original tool by the same name only supports **HTML**. Markdown is often used to format readme files, for writing messages in online discussion forums, and to create rich text using a plain text editor.

# Markdown Syntax

**Philosophy**

*Markdown* is intended to be as easy-to-read and easy-to-write as is feasible.

Readability, however, is emphasized above all else. A markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it's been marked up with tags or formatting instructions.
